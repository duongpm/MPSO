This is the source code for the algorithm **Motion-Encoded Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO)**. The current implementation is for the optimal search of a lost target with the focus on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found in the paper:

To run the program, download all the source files and run "MPSO_MAIN.m" in MATLAB.

*Note:* The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox needs installing to run the code.
